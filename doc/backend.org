  Konserve provides a minimalistic user interface that can be understood as a
  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnROywmy_HI&list=PLetHPRQvX4a-c3KDRTxxwGRmEMutL8Apf&index=4][lense]] into key-value stores. It's main purpose is portability to as many
  backends as possible. This document is describing how to implement them. Feel
  free to ignore parts of this document to get something running quickly, but be
  aware that we can only support backends that adhere to this document.

  This document assumes the following context:

** Necessary preconditions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h:c9e81de1-064f-4953-a321-48584bebe100

   - basic understanding of [[https://github.com/clojure/core.async][core.async]]

** Provided postconditions

** Target audience
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h:041fdf32-f2b3-4e7b-90b4-910106ee5c08
   :END:
   Clojure developers with the need to durably store data with a flexible
   interface, e.g. users of [[https://github.com/replikativ/datahike][Datahike]] or [[https:/replikativ.io/][replikativ]] or developers who want to
   [[https://whilo.github.io/articles/16/unified-storage-io][retain portability of their storage backend in general]].

** Related work
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h:df77b6cc-65cc-4c43-a5a1-be5d98ffa072
   :END:
   [[https://datomic.com][Datomic]] is providing a set of storage backends for its persistent indices. There
   are also [[https://github.com/maxogden/abstract-blob-store][libraries]] for JavaScript that provide a similar interface, but without
   the lense-like interface and to our knowledge all other libraries are not
   cross-platform between JVM and JavaScript.

* Memory model
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h:ad0f4a4d-8581-4c21-94bf-a3c736aa4c1b
  :END:
  Konserve tracks contextual information in a binary header that is sufficient to
  determine how to access a value, it carries the version of the header format,
  the serialization context and the size of the metadata.
  
** ACID
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h:e8add7fe-33dc-4bba-a1a3-3895c19ad844
   :END:
   Konserve is providing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID][ACID]] guarantees for each key-value pair stored in it. 

*** Atomicity
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h:4311c3a1-2287-40ac-bcde-a97affbe2a3b
    :END:
    Your write operation must either completely succeed or fail and cleanly reset
    on *any* error condition. In other words the store must never be corrupted by
    partial write operations! Typically this is provided by the underlying store,
    but you might need to first write a new value and then do an atomic swap, as is
    done in the filestore with an atomic file renaming. The metadata update and the
    value update need to be updated in the same atomic transaction.
 
*** Consistency
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h:88a73805-5229-439e-94a7-a4bc8628db80
    :END:
    The underlying store should provide consistent views on the data. This is
    typically not a property you have to worry about, but it is a good idea to point
    your users to the consistency guarantees provided by the underlying store. A
    reasonable backend must at least provide [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)#Read_committed][read-committed]] semantics.

*** Isolation
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h:764ea3ba-0d29-4118-82ef-6ed2a1916484
    :END:
    You are guaranteed by the [[file:../src/konserve/core.cljc#L36][go-locked]] macro to have no concurrent state mutations
    on individual keys. This locking mechanism only holds inside a memory context of
    the current process. If you expect e.g. multiple JVM processes/machines to
    operate on one backend you have to make sure that write operations are properly
    locked between them. Often this can be provided by the underlying distributed
    storage. 

*** Durability
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h:b6a7799b-7bb7-41d7-8473-f33469b4fda4
    :END:
    You must have written all data when the go channel or synchronous function
    yields a value, i.e. everything needs to be transmitted to the backend. This
    guarantee depends on the guarantees of the backend and you are supposed clearly
    document this for your users. It is a good idea to provide configuration options
    for the backend if you see fit. The default store provides a flip to turn off
    =blob-sync='ing for instance, in which case a few write operations can be lost
    on a crash.

* Implementations 
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h:f8ab0765-5082-40fa-8da4-fde091233b45
  :END:
** User facing protocols
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h:e653a3e0-84e8-4885-ab53-3a3d8b414fc5
   :END:
   The boundary between the user facing API's of konserve and the backends are
   defined in [[file:../src/konserve/protocols.cljc][protocols.cljc]] The protocols =PEDNKeyValueStore=,
   =PBinaryKeyValueStore= and =PKeyIterable= are the protocols that need to
   be implemented by each backend. Each protocol method is provided with a map of
   options. One of these options is whether the code should be executed
   synchronously or asynchronously. In the asynchronous case the implementation
   is supposed to return a go channel (or throw an unsupported operation
   exception). Only the operations =-update-in=, =-assoc-in=, =-dissoc= and
   =-bassoc= can /mutate the state/ of the durable medium. They need to ensure
   that the tracked metadata which can be accessed through =get-meta= is written
   consistently with the value. Fortunately you do not need to implement the
   high-level protocols, but in most cases it should be sufficient to implement
   our backing store protocols (see subsection bellow).

*** Semantics
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h:4b620c30-22b4-4040-853b-dd79d5f5cac2
    :END:
    The semantics of each implementation is supposed to follow the memory
    semantics of the corresponding Clojure functions =get-in=, =update-in= etc.
    The mapping can be conveniently studied in the [[file:../src/konserve/memory.cljc][memory store]].

** Backing store protocols
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h:3917749b-fc8b-4a4f-a515-ffe468a3de8a
   :END:
   [[file:./figures/state_machine.png]]

   The figure illustrates the different paths that are taken by read or update
   operations. =io-operation=, =read-blob= and =update-blob= are functions in
   the [[file:../src/konserve/impl/default.cljc][default store]] namespace while each phase dispatches internally on a
   context describing the top-level io operation, e.g. whether reading or
   writing is necessary. This explicit contextual environment is not strictly
   necessary, but reduces duplication of code. The default store uses
   =core.async= for its asynchronous implementation internally.

   While the user facing protocols capture the intent and provide the biggest
   freedom of an implementation, almost all implementations follow the same
   pattern and share the logic between header handling, serialization, locking
   (see figure above). For this reason we have abstracted the low-level
   interfaces =PBackingStore=, =PBackingBlob= and =PBackingLock= from the
   filestore into the [[file:../src/konserve/impl/storage_layout.cljc][storage-layout]] namespace.

   To implement a new backend you only need to provide these protocols and can
   focus only on the interface of loading and storing byte array values
   atomically and safely. In particular a combined write operation of
   =-write-header=, =-write-meta=, =-write-value=/=write-binary= must be visible
   either as a whole or not at all. Read operations must only fetch what is
   needed. You should fetch the needed combination of =header=, =metadata=
   and/or =value=/=binary= ahead-of-time (AOT) in one read by dispatching on the
   contextual =:operation= in the provided =env= argument if you cannot cheaply
   (locally) seek on the open underlying blob handle (such as an
   =AsynchronousFileChannel= in the file store). Look at the =read-blob=
   dispatch on operation in [[file:../src/konserve/impl/default.cljc][the default implementation]] to see which context maps
   to which reads.

   You can acquire a lock (=PBackingLock=) with =-get-lock= to span a
   /transactional/ context over the low-level store. In case you cannot
   guarantee transactional safety over the read and write operations on a blob
   you have to declare that your store cannot be used from /multiple writing/
   processes/instances at the same time and set =lock-blob?= to false. Locking is
   then automatically provided by the user-facing API in the =core= namespace
   with the =go-locked= macro.
   
   The =sync= and =sync-store= operations are optional in case durability can be
   optionally enforced this way on the underlying store (e.g. =fsync= for the
   filestore). Key objects for your store are created through =-path= with a
   string representation for the key (=store-key=). This is what will be passed
   to your read and write functions. In the simplest case you can just use the
   string itself if your implementation does not require the construction of a
   custom path.

   To provide unified code for both the synchronous and asynchronous variant of
   the code we provide the =async+sync= macro in the [[file:../src/konserve/utils.cljc][utils]] namespace. It expands
   both variants of the code and replaces the =core.async= operations =go= and
   =<!= (like async & await) with the synchronous =no-ops= (=do=). Feel free to
   use it as well, but be aware that it is not yet a hygienic macro
   transformation (you can get a conflict with it if you use the translated
   `=go...=` and `=<..=` names as your variable names (which is unlikely, but
   possible). It is also totally fine for implementations to duplicate code
   between synchronous and asynchronous operations if this is easier to manage
   than using this macro. We are in general interest in extending the abilities
   of this cross-platform, cross-execution model meta-programming in the future.

   In summary, a simple (starting) implementation can rely on konserve's
   high-level locking (=-get-lock= can just return =nil=). It is reading values
   selectively according to the protocol invoked and makes sure that the
   combined write operation is atomic. In this case =:in-place?= mode is always
   active and =atomic-move= can therefore be a no-op. Copying (for backups) with
   =copy= is also not needed if the underlying store provides atomic writes.
   =sync= is redundant in this case as well and can be a no-op.

   Finally, if the protocols do not work for your implementation, please reach
   out to us and we will try to fix extend them accordingly if possible. Having
   more backing store implementations is very much in our interest.

** Error handling
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h:4da56b25-ed3b-432c-aff5-2a0b6143f4ac
   :END:
   All internal errors must be caught and returned as a throwable object on the
   return channel following [[https://swannodette.github.io/2013/08/31/asynchronous-error-handling][this simple pattern]]. We provide similar helper macros
   in [[file:../src/konserve/utils.cljc][utils.cljc]]. In the future we plan to add the ability to also pass in an error
   callback to directly call on errors.

** Blocking IO
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h:ca2e0658-daaa-4166-bd50-013fcb253d57
   :END:
   Be aware that you must not use blocking IO operations in go-routines. The
   easiest solution is to spawn threads with =clojure.core.async/thread=, but
   ideally you should provide synchronous and asynchronous IO operations to provide
   maximum scalability. In particular the usage of =<!!= and =>!!= is not allowed
   since it will deadlock =core.async=.

** Serializers
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h:8ac8b35c-9afd-4309-863a-5993b17841f7
   :END:
   Konserve provides the protocol =PStoreSerializer= with a =-serialize= and
   =-deserialize= method. You need to use these methods to serialize the edn
   values, as they are supposed to be configurable by the user. This protocol is
   also used by the =encryptor= s and =compressor= s. The
   serializer-compressor-encryptor combination is configurable and stored in the
   header for each value such that store reconfiguration can happen without
   downtime and migration. This also allows to bulk copy (or cache) values from
   another store locally without changing their representation (you only pay the IO
   cost upfront). The current store configuration will be used whenever they are
   updated or overwritten though.

** Metadata
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h:96674cbe-3534-4627-a847-bc3075b60984
   :END:
   Konserve internally uses metadata that is kept separate from the operations
   on the values. This metadata is used to track the time when values are
   written for example, a functionality that is needed by the concurrent garbage
   collector. The metadata itself is an =edn= map. There are no size limitations
   of metadata fixed in the protocol, if you cannot implement your backend
   without a size limit then please document it. Metadata can also be used by
   third parties to track important contextual information such as user access
   control rights, or, maybe even edit histories, and therefore supporting at
   least a megabyte in size would be future proof. If for some very unfortunate
   reason you have to allocate a fixed size for each metadata element then for
   now at least 16 KiB must be supported. The =get-meta= protocol reads only the
   metadata part of the respective key and therefore should not load or fetch
   the actual value. This functionality is used by the garbage collector and
   potentially other monitoring processes that otherwise would read all data
   regularly.

   1. 20 bytes for metadata size
   2. serialized metadata
   3. serialized or binary value

   Storing the metadata size is necessary to allow to read only the metadata or
   value (and also to skip it) in stores that have to use one big blog and seek
   in it (such as the filestore). You can store the metadata also separately if
   your store allows atomic transactions over both objects, e.g. using two
   columns in a SQL database.

* Migration
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h:6cd7020b-f14d-4feb-96b3-1db67c5cb7cb
  :END:
  Sometimes the chosen internal representation of a store turns out to be
  insufficient as it was for the addition of metadata support as described in this
  document. In this unfortunate situation a migration of the existing durable data
  becomes necessary. Migrations have the following requirements:

  1. They must not lose data, including on concurrent garbage collection.
  2. They should work without user intervention.
  3. They should work incrementally, upgrade each key on access, allowing version
     upgrades in production.
  4. They can break old library versions running on the same store.

  To determine the version of an old key we cannot read it since we do not know
  its version... the version is therefore stored in the first byte of the header
  and will allow you to read old values in case the binary layout of konserve or
  your implementation has to change.

* Tests 
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h:00075680-3ce6-4329-94eb-32ec8ff9174f
  :END:
  =TODO= We provide a =compliance-test= suite that your store has to satisfy to be
  compliant and are working on a low-level compliance test suite for the default
  store.

* Work in progress
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h:c884f0bf-2048-43fc-970b-b6f0a4957c8f
